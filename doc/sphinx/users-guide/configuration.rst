Configuration
=============

This chapter deals with configuration of Varnish Cache. It will not
cover the actual configuration policy that's written in VCL. 

This guide assumes you're running Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat or
Centos. If you're on any other platform you're probably used to doing
some mental translations.
